	abstract = {Lakes, ponds, rivers and streams are prominent features of the Arctic landscape and are also common in many parts of Antarctica. These waters encompass a remarkable variety of conditions for aquatic life, and are proving to be attractive model systems for exploring general ecological themes. Some of these ecosystems have direct global implications, and are also sentinels of global climate change. This book brings together many of the world's leading researchers in polar limnology to describe these diverse aquatic environments and their ecology. It introduces each major ecosystem type including extreme ice shelf and glacial meltwaters; subglacial lakes and rivers; perennially ice-capped lakes; meromictic and epishelf lake systems; tundra lakes and ponds; seasonal streams; and the large Arctic rivers with their associated floodplain lakes. Separate chapters review the geomorphology of polar lake basins, high latitude paleolimnology; biogeochemistry; physical limnology; microbial processes; microbial biodiversity and biogeography; benthic photosynthetic communities including microbial mats and mosses; phytoplankton and primary production; zooplankton and benthic invertebrates; the ecology of high Arctic fish; food web structure and dynamics; and new and emerging themes in high latitude limnology. The book incorporates the overriding theme of climate change impacts as well as direct impacts resulting from human activity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Winter conditions are rapidly changing in temperate ecosystems, particularly for those that experience periods of snow and ice cover. Relatively little is known of winter ecology in these systems, due to a historical research focus on summer ?growing seasons?. We executed the first global quantitative synthesis on under-ice lake ecology, including 36 abiotic and biotic variables from 42 research groups and 101 lakes, examining seasonal differences and connections as well as how seasonal differences vary with geophysical factors. Plankton were more abundant under ice than expected; mean winter values were 43.2\% of summer values for chlorophyll a, 15.8\% of summer phytoplankton biovolume and 25.3\% of summer zooplankton density. Dissolved nitrogen concentrations were typically higher during winter, and these differences were exaggerated in smaller lakes. Lake size also influenced winter-summer patterns for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with higher winter DOC in smaller lakes. At coarse levels of taxonomic aggregation, phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition showed few systematic differences between seasons, although literature suggests that seasonal differences are frequently lake-specific, species-specific, or occur at the level of functional group. Within the subset of lakes that had longer time series, winter influenced the subsequent summer for some nutrient variables and zooplankton biomass.},

However, estimates of global lake abundance are poorly constrained. We used high-resolution satellite imagery to produce a GLObal WAter BOdies database (GLOWABO), comprising all lakes greater than 0.002?km2. GLOWABO contains geographic and morphometric information for {\textasciitilde}117 million lakes with a combined surface area of about 5 ? 106 km2, which is 3.7\% of the Earth's nonglaciated land area. Large and intermediate-sized lakes dominate the total lake surface area. Overall, lakes are less abundant but cover a greater total surface area relative to previous estimates based on statistical extrapolations. The GLOWABO allows for the global-scale evaluation of fundamental limnological problems, providing a foundation for improved quantification of limnetic contributions to the biogeochemical processes at large scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract The duration of seasonal winter ice cover has declined in many mid- and high-latitude regions around the world as climate continues to warm. We obtained data on lake ice breakup dates, air temperature, precipitation, and large-scale climate oscillations for 152 lakes across the northern hemisphere from 1951 to 2014. Ninety-seven percent of study lakes exhibited earlier ice breakup trends. Forty-six percent of the variation in ice breakup trends was driven by spring air temperatures and elevation across the northern hemisphere. However, changes in ice breakup have not always been in a gradual or linear pattern. Using the sequential T-test analysis of regime shifts, we found evidence of abrupt changes in mean ice breakup for 53\% of lakes with shift years identified between 1970 and 2002. Concurrently, we found abrupt changes in mean spring and winter air temperatures, winter precipitation, and large-scale climate oscillations that occurred either the same year or 1?yr prior. Earlier ice breakup and the shortening of the ice season will have consequences for winter heritage, local economies, and lake ecosystems around the world.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the
              mgcv
              package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data. All code and data used to generate this paper are available at:

These models were used to project potential impacts of climate change on ice phenology across Canada; by 2055 (under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC SRES) A2 emissions scenario), freeze-up dates were projected to be an average of 10 days later. Break-up dates were projected to be from 0 to 16 days earlier, with greater changes occurring at higher latitudes.

              We have mapped Antarctic blue-ice areas using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Antarctica cloud-free image mosaic established by the United States Geological Survey. The mosaic consists of 38 scenes acquired from 1980 to 1994. Our results show that approximately 60 000 km
              2
              of blue ice exist for each of the two main types of blue ice: “melt-induced” and “wind-induced”. Normally, the former type is located on slopes in coastal areas where climate conditions (i.e. persistent winds and temperature), together with favourable surface orientation, sustain conditions for surface and near surface melt. The latter blue-ice category occurs near mountains or on outlet glaciers, often at higher elevations, where persistent winds erode snow away year-round, and combined with sublimation creates areas of net ablation. Furthermore, we have identified an additional area of 121 000 km
              2
              as having potential for blue ice. However, in these areas features such as mixed pixels, glazed snow surfaces, crevasses and/or shadows make interpretation more uncertain. In conclusion, a conservative estimate of Antarctic blue-ice area coverage by this method is found to be 120 000 km
              2
              (∼0.8\% of the Antarctic continent), with a potential maximum of 241 000 km

We found that selective principal component analysis (Chavez and Kwarteng 1989), on band ratios of near-IR/green, highlights changes in blue ice areas. The formation and preservation of blue ice is poorly understood, but we suggest that it generally takes longer to increase a blue ice area than to decrease it, and that blue ice extent is most sensitive to changes in accumulation rate. The investigated blue ice area shows a decrease in extent over the two-year period caused by incursion of snow that probably resulted from an increase in accumulation rate. Comparison of two TM images collected 18 days apart shows that transitory snow drifts have little effect on blue ice extent.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Lakes comprise a large portion of the surface cover in northern North America, forming an important part of the cryosphere. The timing of lake ice phenological events (e.g. break-up/freeze-up) is a useful indicator of climate variability and change, which is of particular relevance in environmentally sensitive areas such as the North American Arctic. Further alterations to the present day ice regime could result in major ecosystem changes, such as species shifts and the disappearance of perennial ice cover. The Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) was used to simulate lake ice phenology across the North American Arctic from 1961–2100 using two climate scenarios produced by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM). Results from the 1961–1990 time period were validated using 15 locations across the Canadian Arctic, with both in situ ice cover observations from the Canadian Ice Database as well as additional ice cover simulations using nearby weather station data. Projected changes to the ice cover using the 30-year mean data between 1961–1990 and 2041–2070 suggest a shift in break-up and freeze-up dates for most areas ranging from 10–25 days earlier (break-up) and 0–15 days later (freeze-up). The resulting ice cover durations show mainly a 10–25 day reduction for the shallower lakes (3 and 10 m) and 10–30 day reduction for the deeper lakes (30 m). More extreme reductions of up to 60 days (excluding the loss of perennial ice cover) were shown in the coastal regions compared to the interior continental areas. The mean maximum ice thickness was shown to decrease by 10–60 cm with no snow cover and 5–50 cm with snow cover on the ice. Snow ice was also shown to increase through most of the study area with the exception of the Alaskan coastal areas.},
